What was designed to be a celebration of success turned tragic when CEO Sanjay Shah, 56, and the company president, Raju Datla, 52, fell 15 feet in front of a packed audience at a party for employees of Vistex, a software company based in Barrington, Ill.One of the highlights was an aerial show. A specially designed stage made of wood was elevated 20 feet above the concrete stage using a crane. Shah and Datla were in an iron cage.They were supposed to be lowered, but the iron chain supporting the cage broke on one side, causing them to fall 15 feet onto the main stage.A CBS affiliate in India reported that the accident occurred Thursday night with 700 people in attendance to mark Vistex Asia's successful 25 years in business.Shah injured his leg and hand. Datla suffered a severe head injury.Shah died at the hospital, and Datla is in critical condition.The Vistex flag now sits at half-staff in Barrington. Vistex is a multinational software company founded by Shah in 1999.CBS's India affiliate reported that a case has been registered against the Film City Event Management based on a complaint made by someone from the company.Vistex has 20 global offices and more than 2,000 employees\"}",

Brutal Sheamus was unexpectedly a good father and loved his son a lot.But, now the only person whom he loved was dying in front of his eyes.Liam was suffering from an incurable disease.Sheamus couldn�t watch his son struggling for his every breath.Sheamus� wife and queen Ezina blamed him and said that it was the result of all his sins which had now come as a curse for their child. She believed that God was punishing him for all the bad deeds he did in his whole life.After watching his child�s suffering, Sheamus became insane and more brutal.He killed every physician in his kingdom as they had failed to cure his dying son.Soon, he ordered his guards to abduct all the best physicians from other kingdoms and present them before him.Later, after four days the guards presented before him the twelve best physicians.The abducted men were the most proclaimed physicians from other kingdoms, famous for saving many lives.Sheamus said if his son dies, then he will kill every physician and asked if they want to leave the place alive then they had to save his son�s life.Every physician was given a bag containing all kinds of herbs to prepare any medicine.Soon those miserable and scared magicians of medicine started preparing something to save Sheamus� son�s life as well as their own.At night they all presented before him some medicines except one physician named, Toby.Toby didn�t come with any medicine.King Sheamus got extremely angry to see Toby with empty hands and said, �so you are not interested in saving your life, but don�t think I will give you an easy death�.�King Shemus I have seen this incurable illness earlier�, Toby replied, �I want to tell you a harsh truth, no medicine prepared by my fellow physicians or anyone is enough to save your son�s life so I felt worthless to prepare anything�.�Oh! , you know everything about my child�s illness, so tell me where you had seen this disease earlier and what happened to your patient, did he died like my son will die soon? �, Sheamus asked in his angry voice.�No, he survived, and right now that patient is standing in front of you�, Toby replied.�What do you mean? �, Sheamus asked.�I was that patient who had suffered this disease when I was a young boy and my father had saved my life�, Toby replied.�You knew everything about the cure and now you are telling me all this�, Sheamus got very angry at Toby and continued, �I will take your life right now for your idiotic behavior, just tell me how did your father saved your life and where is he now�.Toby replied, �King Sheamus, my father is no more, but what he did to save me? I think you won�t do that, that is why I thought it worthless to tell you and accepted my fate of death by you�.Sheamus shouted in his heavy voice, �don�t try to puzzle me, explain to me everything clearly how your father had saved you otherwise I am barely holding myself to take your life at any moment�.Toby replied, �King Sheamus I know you will not kill me at least until something happens to your son as I know, right now my life is more valuable after your son�.�Yes�, Sheamus said, �you are right, this is the reason you are still alive and talking to me but not so long. If one more time you tried to puzzle me, I will take your life right now�.�I�m not here to puzzle you�, Toby said, �so you want to know how my father saved my life, then listen he sacrificed his life to save me.�What sacrifice?� Sheamus asked, but this time in a dull voice, �What are you talking about? Tell me clearly?�.Toby said, �outside this kingdom in the jungles of Onuma, grows rare black mushrooms, which can save your child�s life from this incurable disease�.Listening to this the king promptly ordered his guards to bring every black-looking mushroom present in the jungle.Toby said, �King Sheamus, wait, I have to tell you something else�.�I am listening to you�, Sheamus replied, �what do you want more, just tell me?�.Toby said, �King Shemus the rare mushroom only will not save your son but you or the queen.�As anyone from the blood relation of the patient has to eat that rare mushroom and then has to give some drops of his blood in the ill person�s mouth for five days�.�But on the sixth day the person who had eaten the mushroom dies because of the poison present in it, but the patient gets cured completely�.�Oh! So this sacrifice you were talking about�, the King replies to Toby and asks his guards to call the queen.Toby again elaborated everything to the queen.Queen Ezina said, �Dear king Shemus have you forgotten, I�m not your child�s actual mother, you had killed his mother many years ago for deceiving you�.For the first time, the king felt he was not invincible and God was really punishing him for his bad deeds.He soon ordered his guards to release everyone and went to Liam�s room.The abducted physician hurriedly left the place except Toby, who followed Sheamus to his son�s room.Toby saw him crying, regretting, confessing all his sins and blaming himself for his child�s sufferings.At night the guards came with those rare black mushrooms.Sheamus ate those mushrooms and dropped some of his blood into his son�s mouth by cutting his hand.Liam soon started getting better every day and opened his eyes on the fifth day, but on the sixth-day Shemus died leaving all his great empire for the future king.Finally, the brutal king got defeated by his own fate, but a great father won.\"}",

Brutal Sheamus was unexpectedly a good father and loved his son a lot.But, now the only person whom he loved was dying in front of his eyes.Liam was suffering from an incurable disease.Sheamus couldn’t watch his son struggling for his every breath.Sheamus’ wife and queen Ezina blamed him and said that it was the result of all his sins which had now come as a curse for their child. She believed that God was punishing him for all the bad deeds he did in his whole life.After watching his child’s suffering, Sheamus became insane and more brutal.He killed every physician in his kingdom as they had failed to cure his dying son.Soon, he ordered his guards to abduct all the best physicians from other kingdoms and present them before him.Later, after four days the guards presented before him the twelve best physicians.The abducted men were the most proclaimed physicians from other kingdoms, famous for saving many lives.Sheamus said if his son dies, then he will kill every physician and asked if they want to leave the place alive then they had to save his son’s life.Every physician was given a bag containing all kinds of herbs to prepare any medicine.Soon those miserable and scared magicians of medicine started preparing something to save Sheamus’ son’s life as well as their own.At night they all presented before him some medicines except one physician named, Toby.Toby didn’t come with any medicine.King Sheamus got extremely angry to see Toby with empty hands and said, ”so you are not interested in saving your life, but don’t think I will give you an easy death”.“King Shemus I have seen this incurable illness earlier”, Toby replied, “I want to tell you a harsh truth, no medicine prepared by my fellow physicians or anyone is enough to save your son’s life so I felt worthless to prepare anything”.“Oh! , you know everything about my child’s illness, so tell me where you had seen this disease earlier and what happened to your patient, did he died like my son will die soon? ”, Sheamus asked in his angry voice.“No, he survived, and right now that patient is standing in front of you”, Toby replied.“What do you mean? ”, Sheamus asked.“I was that patient who had suffered this disease when I was a young boy and my father had saved my life”, Toby replied.“You knew everything about the cure and now you are telling me all this”, Sheamus got very angry at Toby and continued, ”I will take your life right now for your idiotic behavior, just tell me how did your father saved your life and where is he now”.Toby replied, “King Sheamus, my father is no more, but what he did to save me? I think you won’t do that, that is why I thought it worthless to tell you and accepted my fate of death by you”.Sheamus shouted in his heavy voice, “don’t try to puzzle me, explain to me everything clearly how your father had saved you otherwise I am barely holding myself to take your life at any moment”.Toby replied, “King Sheamus I know you will not kill me at least until something happens to your son as I know, right now my life is more valuable after your son”.“Yes”, Sheamus said, “you are right, this is the reason you are still alive and talking to me but not so long. If one more time you tried to puzzle me, I will take your life right now”.“I’m not here to puzzle you”, Toby said, ”so you want to know how my father saved my life, then listen he sacrificed his life to save me.“What sacrifice?” Sheamus asked, but this time in a dull voice, “What are you talking about? Tell me clearly?”.Toby said, “outside this kingdom in the jungles of Onuma, grows rare black mushrooms, which can save your child’s life from this incurable disease”.Listening to this the king promptly ordered his guards to bring every black-looking mushroom present in the jungle.Toby said, “King Sheamus, wait, I have to tell you something else”.“I am listening to you”, Sheamus replied, ”what do you want more, just tell me?”.Toby said, ”King Shemus the rare mushroom only will not save your son but you or the queen.“As anyone from the blood relation of the patient has to eat that rare mushroom and then has to give some drops of his blood in the ill person’s mouth for five days”.“But on the sixth day the person who had eaten the mushroom dies because of the poison present in it, but the patient gets cured completely”.“Oh! So this sacrifice you were talking about”, the King replies to Toby and asks his guards to call the queen.Toby again elaborated everything to the queen.Queen Ezina said, “Dear king Shemus have you forgotten, I’m not your child’s actual mother, you had killed his mother many years ago for deceiving you”.For the first time, the king felt he was not invincible and God was really punishing him for his bad deeds.He soon ordered his guards to release everyone and went to Liam’s room.The abducted physician hurriedly left the place except Toby, who followed Sheamus to his son’s room.Toby saw him crying, regretting, confessing all his sins and blaming himself for his child’s sufferings.At night the guards came with those rare black mushrooms.Sheamus ate those mushrooms and dropped some of his blood into his son’s mouth by cutting his hand.Liam soon started getting better every day and opened his eyes on the fifth day, but on the sixth-day Shemus died leaving all his great empire for the future king.Finally, the brutal king got defeated by his own fate, but a great father won.\\\"}",
