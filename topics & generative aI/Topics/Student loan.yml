        Taking a student loan can be a big financial commitment. It's important to carefully consider your ability to pay it back. If you're unable to pay back your student loan, here are some alternatives you can explore:
        1. Income-driven repayment plans: These plans adjust your monthly loan payments based on your income.
        2. Loan forgiveness programs: Some professions or public service jobs offer loan forgiveness programs.
        3. Refinancing or consolidation: You may be able to refinance or consolidate your loans to get a lower interest rate or more manageable repayment terms.
        
        It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor or student loan counselor to discuss your specific situation and explore the best options for you.
